                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the Catering Management app! This tool is designed to be your all-in-one solution for managing clients, creating a library of your dishes, and planning events down to the last detail.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
                    <p>The app is built around three main components: your <strong>Dish Library</strong>, your <strong>Clients</strong>, and your <strong>Events</strong>. For the best experience, it's recommended to add some dishes and clients before creating your first event.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> All your data is saved instantly and securely in your browser's local storage. There's no need to manually save your work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> For safety and portability, you can back up your data to a file on your computer using the features on the <strong>Preferences</strong> page.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Feature Guide</h2>

                    <h3>Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>The dashboard is your home screen. It provides an at-a-glance view of all events scheduled within the <strong>next 7 days</strong>, helping you focus on what's immediately important.</p>

                    <h3>Dish Library</h3>
                    <p>This is where you build your menu. You can add, edit, and delete every dish your company offers. Each dish includes a name, category, price per serving, and a description. This library is used to build menus when you create an event.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Client Management</h3>
                    <p>Keep track of your customers here. You can add new clients or edit existing ones. When you create an event, you will select a client from this list.</p>

                    <h3>Event Management</h3>
                    <h4>The Event List</h4>
                    <p>This page lists all your events. It's designed for quick access and powerful filtering:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Events are sorted to show upcoming events first (starting with the soonest) and past events last.</li>
                        <li><strong>Highlighting:</strong> Events happening <strong>today</strong> are highlighted with a light blue background and a side border for easy identification.</li>
                        <li><strong>Search:</strong> Use the search bar to instantly find events by a client's name or the event's venue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Filters:</strong> You can filter the list to show only events with a specific status (e.g., "Confirmed") or view all events scheduled for a specific date using the date picker.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Creating & Editing an Event</h4>
                    <p>This is the most detailed page. When you create or edit an event, you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Select a Client:</strong> Start typing a client's name in the searchable dropdown to quickly find and select them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set Event Details:</strong> Add the date, time, venue, and guest count. The app will warn you if you select a date where the client already has another booking. You cannot create new events in the past.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build a Menu:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Click "Add Dish" to open a pop-up of your entire Dish Library.</li>
                                <li>As you select dishes, the pop-up shows you an <strong>estimated cost</strong> based on the guest count.</li>
                                <li>When you add dishes, their quantity will automatically default to the event's guest count. You can then change the quantity for each dish individually.</li>
                                <li>If you change the main guest count, the app will ask if you want to update all dish quantities to match.</li>
                                <li>The <strong>Total Estimated Cost</strong> updates in real-time as you build the menu.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <h2>Preferences & Data Management</h2>
                    <p>This page gives you full control over your data backups.</p>
                    <h4>Auto-Save (Recommended)</h4>
                    <p>This is the best way to keep your data safe. After a one-time setup where you choose a file on your computer, the app will automatically save a backup to that file every 15 seconds, but <strong>only if you've made changes</strong>. This is highly efficient and provides peace of mind against data loss.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Manual Import / Export</h4>
                    <p>You can also manually save a complete snapshot of your data (Export) or restore your app from a backup file (Import). This is useful for moving your data to a new computer.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
                    
                    <h4>Can I use this app on multiple devices?</h4>
                    <p>Not simultaneously. The data is stored locally in the browser on a single computer. To move your data from one computer to another, use the <strong>Export</strong> feature on the old computer and the <strong>Import</strong> feature on the new one.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What happens if I delete a Client or a Dish?</h4>
                    <p>If you delete a client or a dish, any events that used them will be affected. A deleted client's name will show as "N/A" in the event list, and a deleted dish will disappear from any event menus it was part of. This action cannot be undone, so please be careful.</p>
